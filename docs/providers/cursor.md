# Cursor

TokenLedger OMP tracks plan usage from the Cursor account already signed in on your computer.

## What it tracks

| Metric                           | Meaning                                               |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Total Usage                      | Overall plan usage for the current billing period     |
| Auto Usage                       | Usage assigned to Cursor's Auto model selection       |
| API Usage                        | API usage reported by Cursor                          |
| Extra Usage                      | On-demand usage when it is available for the account  |
| Requests                         | Included request usage for supported plans            |
| Credits                          | Remaining or available credits reported by Cursor     |
| Today / Yesterday / Last 30 Days | Tokens and estimated spend from Cursor's usage export |
| Usage Trend                      | Recent exported usage over time                       |

## Sign-in and local data

Sign in through the Cursor app or run `agent login`. TokenLedger OMP looks for Cursor's local application
state and platform credential storage, so no separate TokenLedger OMP login is required.

Recent history comes from Cursor's usage export. Exported data can arrive later than live account
usage, so spend and token totals may briefly lag behind the quota meters.

## Troubleshooting

- **Not logged in** — open Cursor and sign in, or run `agent login`.
- **Session expired** — sign in again through Cursor or the agent CLI.
- **Some metrics show No data** — Cursor returns different fields for different plans.
- **History is delayed** — wait for Cursor's usage export to update, then refresh TokenLedger OMP.
