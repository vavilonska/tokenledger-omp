## Project philosophy

TokenLedger OMP aims for clean design, fast performance, and a focused user experience. Its purpose is
simple: make AI coding subscription usage and quota limits easy to understand without interrupting
the user's work.

New features should fit that purpose, follow the existing architecture, and remain useful across the
supported desktop platforms where applicable. Prefer clear, maintainable solutions over unnecessary
abstractions, dependencies, or complexity. Keep changes small and focused; do not over-engineer.

## Before opening an issue

- Search existing issues and pull requests first.
- Reproduce against the current TokenLedger OMP source or your local build; include its commit.
- Include your operating system, architecture, TokenLedger OMP version, and affected provider.
- Never post credentials, access tokens, account identifiers, or unreviewed diagnostic logs.

Security vulnerabilities should not be reported in a public issue. Follow
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) instead.

## Development setup

You need Node.js 22 or later, pnpm 11.11.0, stable Rust, and the
[Tauri 2 prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) for your platform.

```sh
corepack pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
corepack pnpm tauri dev
```

Run the complete quality checks before submitting a pull request:

```sh
corepack pnpm verify
```

## Pull requests

- Keep each pull request focused on one change.
- Explain the problem and the chosen solution.
- Add or update tests when behavior changes.
- Include screenshots for visible interface changes.
- Keep platform-specific behavior working on Windows, macOS, and Linux where applicable.
- Do not include unrelated formatting, generated build output, credentials, or local configuration.
